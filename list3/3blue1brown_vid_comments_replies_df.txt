The claim that Beysian theorem has helped some A.I. researchers figure out how to program something or other.   Let&#39;s propose two possible interpretations for that claim, one in which, if true, Beys contributed to the progress, and one in which he didn&#39;t.<br><br>1)  The A.I. guys were stumped, couldn&#39;t move forward, began groping about in their minds or in mathematical or philosophical literature, for something that might help them.  They came across hundreds or thousands of theorems, tried to see if any of them might be of use, and then, stumbling across Beys&#39; theorem, they found it to, indeed be of use.<br>   Then, in some interview about their progress, they gave due credit, saying, &#39;we used Beys&#39; theorem.&#39;   This is what seems to be implied.  And in this case, indeed Byes contributed to the discovery.<br><br>2)  The A.I. guys were trying to figure out something using their own reasoning, because they&#39;re pretty smart, <i>did</i> figure it out, and then somebody who had heard of Beys&#39; theorem noticed that the logic they used was the same as that of Beys.  The boys were happy to hear that, as having one&#39;s name attached to another famous name is kind of a good thing in science and technology.  So, in an interview, they mentioned that the logic they had used was &quot;Beysian logic.&#39; <br>   And that&#39;s true, it was.  But only because Beys name has been attached to a universal pattern that thousands of people have noticed over and over again forever.   In this case, Beys did not actually contribute at all to the progress made by the A.I. guys.<br><br>Which is it?  Is this the same pattern of academic types, who produce nothing, trying to take credit for what other people produce, by the happenstance of similar logic having been employed?<br>   To me, possibility two seems more likely, because guys doing A.I. research, or trying to forge a new field, see most likely to be the kind of people who think for themselves.   Also because they the investment of time into going through the litany of socially, but non-legally patented logic patterns, out of hundreds, to find a useful one, must seem intuitively - and probably correctly - like an inefficient waste of time.   That&#39;s just not what people are gonna do.  When A.I. researchers run into a problem, they don&#39;t break out the philosophy tomb, and settle into the sofa with a pipe for a week of inane abstractions that are extremely unlikely to be applicable to the problem they wish to solve.<br>   They just try to think through the problem logically, for themselves.<br><br>So, did Beys&#39; Theorem contribute in any way to any progress made ever in A.I research?

The problem certainly is whether maths logic was rusing or unaware of colloquial communicative logic, that we constantly reinterpret and add to the question when we answer, as those above and you have. The problem is perfectly put by grant, that when its phrased as proportion it becomes clear. I feel like that means though envisioning first not so much a circle B as a subset of a larger circle A, but the values are in the proportional bar as presented -not overlapped, but adjacent, as that does imply some separation path of A/or not (~=B), or, B/ or not (~=A). <br><br>The real frustration comes with the idea that, asking out of 100 people what is more likely, A or B,  means the entire information provided about Linda&#39;s background becomes irrelevant, and now its just a guess out of 100 people what is more likely, which does makes you want to say I don&#39;t know about A or B but I suppose more A because more bank tellers. But do we actually know if there&#39;s more tellers than those with that prior experience who are both tellers and in the feminist movement more generally? Isn&#39;t it also right to say, given that lack of knowledge, its equally possible to envision that rather than A being more likely, that they would either both be true (B) or neither be true, but not A without B?  <br><br>I somehow feel that the logical option is that they are equally likely or equally unlikely, 50/50? So not being forced to pick? People seem to be inclined anyway to do an equation of comparing the probabilities of - Linda will become a banker or not, and linda will become involved in the feminist movement or not, and trying to resolve a single answer for how likely she will do both or not. Now my problem comes from a different angle, I feel for the people that think there is no basis for inferring from the statement prior to hypothesis, where it kind of makes the answer as irrelevant as the question -how likely is she or anyone else to be a banker or be a banker activist (i don&#39;t know, ask them, then ask me how likely that answer would be as a wider estimate for everyone), and therefore a psychological study not about human error, but how best to teach what you want people to actually understand (like grants solution - are there more bank tellers or bank tellers in the feminist movement = B can&#39;t be bigger than A). But I also feel for the people that think, qualitative description should have relevance or therefore the question is misleading unless re-interpreted to re-introduce to the relevance (literally how likely is this given person to be a feminist even if she is a banker). Again, is it wrong to assume that people who are described as dedicated to movements like social justice and anti-nuclear would lend solidarity to feminism, and as a corollary will be likely to pursue those things regardless of their occupation? (i.e., isn&#39;t B just as likely?). I can see people wanting to say if they have to make a choice on Linda the latter is more likely, but I see it as, if you think the qualitative matters in conjunction with the qualitative estimate, then you may choose still B, but that must include A, so they are both 100% likely in the case of choosing B...and if you add that to the quantitative, which says B can&#39;t be more likely than A for any given person because of logic, then that still leaves the option of the options being equally likely at 50%, or both 0% likely. In my mind, that wants to afford both for what the &quot;answer&quot; could be - both the qualitative social movement studies/activism/identity question, and the maths lesson here, but I can&#39;t see a way to escape answering this question with 0%/50% for both, and only that answer (wouldn&#39;t it be crazy though if 100% of bank tellers like linda were found to actually be in the feminist movement, now that would be counterintuitive even though i guess no problem - subset is still just equal size to set, but perhaps they switch roles/names). Perhaps people who feel slighted by the question were also moved that way by the implication of the authors and even grant here that option A is &#39;more right&#39; logically regardless of the information provided, even though there is maybe possibility for an even size of likelihood, which allows that neither is more/less likely without violating logic - at both 0 or at B with both likely  (which i can see as part of my broader idea of 50/50 if you include option A as equally likely). But does this ruin the bayesian structuring if its always 50/50 or adding to it as neither A/B - 0%, or B(both A/B) 100% likely, I think i introduced overlap with the latter two but what about always 50/50?<br><br>That experiment really does seem to be one about the social impact of phrasing in a question involving statistics, so it did it&#39;s job. And grant did his showing the maths logic underlying the question, how to think more correctly about it as a statistical problem, and how to phrase a question around that to get the best results that you think are more right. Most people seemed to be answering the question, given Linda&#39;s history, is she likely to become a feminist, and went with that answer. Which I don&#39;t think is a good survey answer/structure, it should be an interview. I&#39;ve met people in my research who would answer yes to that because they have deep history of the anti-nuclear and feminist movements&#39; solidarity, and people who would answer yes to that because they think all left-leaning philosophies breed the exact same person regardless of how logic applies to occupation in the context. Talking about the tendency of interpreting the question, qualitatively there&#39;s even another implied question to me here.
