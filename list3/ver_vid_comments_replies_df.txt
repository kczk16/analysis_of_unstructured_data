P[Sick | Positive] is never equal to P[Sick] / P(Positive). In reality, the true value is either I am sick (100%) or not (0%).

I set my prior belief incredibly close to the reality where I am not sick (close to 0%)&#39;, not &#39;I am unsure whether I am sick or not&#39;.

That is not the same as saying there is a 9% or 90% chance that we are sick. We either are, or we are not.

Picture in your mind a graph with an x axis and a y axis.  Along the X axis (from left to right) are number from 0 to 100, represent the &quot;chances of having disease x&quot; . (think of significant coronary artery narrowing as a good example).  The y axis is the same, with numbers 0 to 100 going from bottom (where the x and y axis meet) upwards to 100.  The x axis represent your thoughts on the probability of a person having a disease and the y axis represent your thoughts on the probably of the person having the disease after some test is done.  (a treadmill exercise test, testing for heart disease, for example).  Now, picture a diagonal line starting where the x axis meets the y axis and is drawn at a 45 degree angle from lower left to upper right.  This line represents a worthless test.  If you think (based upon prior knowledge) that a person has a 30 percent chance of having a disease and after the test you can do no better but to still think that the person has a 30 percent chance of having the disease, there would be a point on that diagonal.  Now, consider, if you will, a test that has some value.  It is not a perfect test, but it is a reasonably good test.  In that case, the point would lie on a bowed curve that started at (or near) the intersection of the x and y axis and ended on the far upper right of the diagonal.  There are two curves,  The are drawn as bowed curves that extend a) upwards and left of the diagonal and b) downwards and to the right of the diagonal.  A test that had modest value would not deviate very far from the diagonal and a test that is fairly accurate would deviate further.   The two curves represent whether a test is positive for the disease or negative.  If the test is positive the curve bows upwards and to the left and if the test is negative, the curve bows downwards and to the right.  Her is what it means.   If you have person who you think has about a 50 percent chance of having a disease (based upon prior knowledge) and you run the test.  In this setting a positive value has the most value and a negative test has the most value.   If the person has only a 5 percent chance of having a disease (based upon prior knowledge) the the curves do not deviate very far from the diagonal.  That is, even if the test is positive, it is unlikely to be a true positive.  And it the test is negative.... well, you already expected that.  At the very other end, if you think that a person has a 90 percent chance of having the disease and the test is negative, you have to figure that it is a false negative.  In other words, the value of doing the test in people that almost certainly do not have the disease is of very little value.  Of those who almost certainly have the disease, the test is of very little value.  But it is in those who have a medium chance of having a disease where the test has value.  Not all tests are like this, of course.  Getting a complete blood count to see if someone is anemic is an extremely accurate test, and a positive and negative result hardly ever has false positives or false negative.  But there are plenty of other tests that are like this.  Today I read about Kim Kardasian having a &quot;positive test for lupus&quot; and realize that if they are speaking about the ANA test..... well, that is one that has plenty of false positives.  If she does not have symptoms of lupus, she would fall on the very lower left hand end of the positive curve, making one think that it is probably a false positive.', 0], '2020-10-08T15:31:29Z': ['@Joe Dart Very well put, I&#39;ll keep that one.', 0], '2020-08-16T23:22:08Z': ['@Michael Ibrahim Yes.

As you say, repeating the test with the same exact assay is not going to change your confidence level that the initial test was correct. Using a different test assay, usually of a completely different type that is known to be able to distinguish drugs A and Z, is necessary to confirm that the initial test result was a true positive. In medical parlance, we would say that we want the initial &quot;screening&quot; test assay to have a high &quot;sensitivity&quot; and at least a fair &quot;specificity&quot; so that we do not miss any samples with drug A in them even if we capture some samples with drug Z in them, too.

But when it comes to issues like &#39;certainty&#39;, particularly as it&#39;s related to opinion, we live in a world where we are asked to treat people&#39;s opinions as fact.  Which leads them to believe opinions ARE fact, which in turn leads to certainty when probably none should exist. <br>There is also the issue of language.  Most people will say &quot;It&#39;s always true that the sun rises in the East.&quot;  Well, not really.  Sometimes, and depending on where you are, it&#39;s northeast.  So ALWAYS is a strong word.  But we generally understand the meaning.  It&#39;s true enough that the sun rises in the East.  Few of us will dispute that - however imprecise it is.  If you&#39;re out sailing on the ocean, it may be more meaningful, though, to know the direction properly.<br>Similarly, saying &quot;Water ALWAYS freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit.&quot;  Well, yes, it does under &#39;normal&#39; circumstances, but &#39;normal&#39; is rarely the case.  While we can say this is another situation where language is imprecise but understood, it really shouldn&#39;t be.  But again, unless you&#39;re working in a lab and require some degree of precision, you&#39;re not going to press this fact too hard.<br>Finally, it&#39;s still another situation to say &quot;You ALWAYS provide the reports to me with errors.&quot;  Well, depending on the situation, the imprecision of ALWAYS becomes problematic.  Few people remember how often things are done correctly, and the errors tend to be the times which are remembered more.  In our minds, we create false narratives which become opinion, and those opinions, to us, become fact - even after they are disproven by studying them.  <br><br>As a rule, my wife and I have tried to remove absolutes like &quot;always&quot; or &quot;never&quot; from our vocabulary.  I try very hard to keep them at a minimum.  It&#39;s not always easy, but it&#39;s worth the effort.

I am a grad student (yes, in stats) and I saw everything here in stats theory 1. I think if it is a undergrad class, the professor may be very selective about what to cover and in what detail. Plus, some concepts require a lot of background in math and other stats concepts to really understand well. Thus, when taking, say, and undergrad Math stats vs a similar graduate math stats course, you&#39;ll probably notice a huge difference in what material you encounter. The respective sets of material you cover in each certainly won&#39;t be disjoint or anything, but what you focus on (the detail, proofs, etc.) will most likely be much different.<br><br>I never took an undergrad stochastic processes class, but I&#39;d imagine it may have to focus on things like conditional expectations and how to compute them, MCs, maybe even a refresh of linear algebra. These things can really take time away from the finer details of stats, which is unfortunate but inevitable. That being said, you bring up a good point - stats, perhaps more so than any other field I have experience with, is taught... strangely to non-stats students. I feel like very few non-statisticians have a good idea what a p-value is, what probability is, why stats works, and so on. It was more like, &quot;here is a t-test and when to use one; here is linear regression and how to compute calculations; here is the Wilcoxon sign-rank test (not even very useful...); here is an F-test...&quot; It makes it come off as dry and there is often lots of hand-waving. I think the reason for this is because, mathematically, stats gets complex. You need to know calculus, linear algebra, probability, analysis (real &amp; complex if you want to get into some serious theory) and more, and you better know it well.
